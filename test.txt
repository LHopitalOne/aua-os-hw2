In þe dayes of olde,
whan þe world was ful of grete mysauentures
and men weren ofte in doute of here lyf,
þer was a litel toun ycleped Wycheforde,
sette by þe ryuer þat ranne slowe and murky
through þe medewes.

Þe folk of þat toun weren ful symple and lowly,
and here werkes weren of smale worth,
for þei spente moost of here houres
in tyllynge of þe feldes
and kepynge of bestes.

Now it bifel þat in þe monethe of Aprile,
whan þe shoures softe descendeth
and þe floures of þe erthe waxen faire,
þe burgeys of Wycheforde gadered hem togidre
in þe commune halle,
for to speken of grete materes
concernynge þe warde of here towneshepe.

Þere was greet strif bitwene hem,
for som seide þat þe brigge ouer þe ryuer
was feble and broken,
and shulde be mended withoute taryenge,
lest þe cartes and horsen falle doun
and be loste.

Oþer seide þat it were better
to spende þe tresour of þe toun
vpon þe walles and þe dyk,
for ofte tymes wilde men out of þe forest
camen to robben and brennen.

Þe alderman,
an olde man ful of craft and subtil wit,
stood vp
and seyde in a vois lowe and dredful:
“Gode men of Wycheforde,
herkeneth now to me.
Þis strif shal lede vs to naught but wrecchednesse.

Yif we spende oure siluer on þe brigge,
we shal haue no peny for þe walles;
yif we mende þe walles,
þe brigge shal falle.
Þus mote we chese wysely.”

Þe folk murmured,
and þe nyght wexen derk,
and þei were ful wery of speche and rede.

At þe laste
a yong man,
newe come from ferre lond,
roos and cryed with greet boldnesse,
“Sires,
why stryuen ye so mykel for smale þinges?

The main nede is not þe brigge
ne þe walles,
but þe vnitee of oure hertes.
For yif we dwellen euer in debate,
þe enemys of Wycheforde
shal fynde vs feble
and take al.”

Þe wordes semed straunge to hem,
for never bifore hadde any man spoken so.

Som nodden here hedes in consente,
oþer grucched
and seyden it was but ydel talk.

Þus they sate til þe cok crowede,
and euene thane
no ful purpos was taken.

And so endeth þe tale of Wycheforde,
a mater neither merie ne sory,
but tolde for no cause
saue to shewe how men,
whan þei haue to moche wordes
and to litel werk,
wasten here dayes in strif
þat bringeth hem no wele.
